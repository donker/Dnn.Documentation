# Install an Extension

## Prerequisites

**A host / super user account.** Hosts have full permissions to all sites in the DNN instance. A host account is required to upload modules and themes, because they might contain executable code. (An administrator account is sufficient to apply modules and themes to a website.)

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Settings \> Extensions.
    
    ![Persona Bar > Settings > Extensions](img/scr-pbar-host-Settings-E91.png)
    
    ➊
    
    ➋
    
2.  Click/Tap Install Extension.

3.  Upload the zip file containing the extension package.

4.  Informational pages will be displayed one after the other:
    
    *   Package Information includes the extension's version and description, as well as information about the creator.

    *   Release Notes displays what's new in the current release of the extension.

    *   License displays the creator's license terms. Accept the license to continue.

    *   Package Installation Report displays a log of actions performed by the installation.

5.  Verify that the newly installed extension appears in the list under the Installed Extensions tab.
