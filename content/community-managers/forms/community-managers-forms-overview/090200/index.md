# About the Form Builder

## Form Builder

The Form Builder allows you to create forms easily by dragging and dropping fields into a canvas. Each field you add to the canvas is customizable; you can change its label, set limits on the data, or make the field required.

You can add any of the following types of fields to your form:

*   [Address](form-field-address)
*   [Date / Time](form-field-date-time)
*   [Dropdown](form-field-dropdown)
*   [Email](form-field-email)
*   [E-Signature](form-field-esignature)
*   [Multi-Line Text](form-field-multi-line-text)
*   [Multiple Choice](form-field-multiple-choice)
*   [Name](form-field-name)
*   [Number](form-field-number)
*   [Phone Number](form-field-phone-number)
*   [Single-Line Text](form-field-single-line-text)
*   [Static Text](form-field-static-text)
*   [Terms and Conditions](form-field-terms-conditions)
*   [URL / Website](form-field-url-website)

You can also configure the [Submit](form-field-submit) button.

In addition, you can assign [hidden fields](about-hidden-fields) with values that are sent back with the completed form.
