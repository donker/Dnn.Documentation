# Retrieve System Information

Note: In the DNN Platform, you can manage the web servers by using SQL commands (e.g., `select * from webservers`) through the SQL Console.

## Prerequisites

*   **A host / super user account.** Hosts have full permissions to all sites in the DNN instance.

## Steps

1.  Go to Persona Bar \> Settings \> Servers.
