3.  Choose how the page's state is persisted (Page State Persistence).
    
    *   Page. Information about the page's state is stored in a hidden field in the page. Recommended.
    *   Memory. Information about the page's state is cached in memory.

    Description
    
    Caching Provider
    
    The default caching provider for the site.

    Module Cache Provider
    
    The default caching provider for modules. Each module can override this setting.
    
    *   File. The cache is stored in a file. Choose this if your server tends to run out of memory. Default.
    *   Memory. The cache is stored in memory. Fastest performance.
    *   Database. The cache is stored in a database. To be deprecated.
    
    Page Output Cache Provider
    
    The default caching provider for pages. Caching is enabled for a page, only if the cache timeout is set for that page.

    The relative length of time that items remain in cache.
    
    *   NoCaching. No caching. Worst performance.
    *   LightCaching. Items are held in cache for the shortest time.
    *   ModerateCaching. Items are held in cache for a moderate length of time.
    *   HeavyCaching. Items are held in cache for the longest time. Best performance. Default.
    
    Authenticated Cacheability  
    Unauthenticated Cacheability
    
    The value of the Cache-Control field in the HTTP general header. The Cache-Control field indicates how caching is done. Authenticated Cacheability specifies the caching behavior for authenticated users; Unauthenticated Cacheability for anonymous users.

    (Optional) If enabled (On), a secure connection is used when synchronizing the caches of enabled web servers.
    
6.  Save.
