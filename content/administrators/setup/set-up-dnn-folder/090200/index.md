# Set Up the DNN Folder and the User Account

## Steps

1.  [Download DNN and extract the files.](http://www.dnnsoftware.com/community/download/)
    
    Note: If you get a Windows Security Warning while attempting to unzip the file, you might need to [unblock the DNN zip file](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/delay/p/unblockingdownloadedfile/) then try again. WARNING: For your protection, remember to download or unzip files from reliable sources only.
    
    The folder where you extract the files becomes the DNN installation folder.
    
    **Developers and Designers:** For module or theme development, you don't need the source files.
    
2.  Determine the user account used to run your website.
    
    The account name differs, depending on your IIS and Windows version:
    
    If your OS is
    
    and your IIS version is
    
    then the account name is

    IIS 7
    
    localmachine\\Network Service
    
    Windows 7
    
    Windows Server 2008 R2
    
    IIS 7.5
    
    the **NETWORK SERVICE** account
    
    \- or -
    
    the **IIS AppPool\\AppPoolName**, which is the name of the automatically generated app.
    
    Windows 8
    
    Windows Server 2012
    
    IIS 8
    
    Windows 10
    
    IIS 10
    
3.  Give **Full** or **Modify** permissions for the DNN installation folder to the user account that will run your website.
